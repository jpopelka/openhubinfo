## OpenHub Info ##

Uses [Ohloh API](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/ohloh_api) to get info (json) about an [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net) project or account.

### Example ###

`OH_API_KEY='...' ./openhubinfo.py -i project docker`

You need to set OH_API_KEY environment variable to your Ohloh API key. If you don't have one, obtain it at https://www.openhub.net/accounts/your_login/api_keys/new (replace your_login with existing OpenHub login).
